# CV
This repo includes multiple projects, all of which are application of hand tracking module created using opencv and mediapipe.
1. Virtual Mouse : 
In this project, I controlled PC's mouse using hand gestures. One can move the mouse cursor with the movement of index finger and can select a particular item on screen by raising index and middle finger together. The fingers movement are traced by hand tracking module.
2. Volume Controller :
Using this project, I can control the computer's volume with my hands. The distance between tips of index finger and middle finger will vary the volume. If I want to increase the volume then I will move the fingers in opposite direction and similarily, to decrease volume, bring the fingers closer to each other.
3. Air Canvas :
As the name suggests, here's an invisible board to write and draw with different color pens and an option to erase the mess too. To draw use your index finger and to select pens or eraser, raise index and middle finger together.
