This repo includes multiple projects, all of which are applications of hand tracking module created using OpenCV and media pipe.

1. Virtual Mouse:
In this project, I controlled the PC's mouse using hand gestures. One can move the mouse cursor with the movement of the index finger and can select a particular item on screen by raising the index and middle finger together. The fingers' movements are traced by the hand tracking module.

2. Volume Controller: 
Using this project, I can control the computer's volume with my hands. The distance between the tips of the index finger and middle finger will vary the volume. If I want to increase the volume then I will move the fingers in the opposite direction and similarly, to decrease volume, bring the fingers closer to each other.

3. Air Canvas:
As the name suggests, here's an invisible board to write and draw with different color pens and an option to erase the mess too. To draw use your index finger and to select pens or eraser, raise index and middle finger together.
